		The program reads and writes using threads to a single array, managing it with 
		read/write locks.
		The writers try to add or remove numbers from the array and the readers try to find numbers
		in the array
     
     
 Compile: gcc -Wall -pthread ex1a.c -lm -o ex1a
 Run: ./ex1a
 	 
 Output: The program will print to standard out the results of the thread reading and writing.

     	The program fills an array of primes simulteniously and when it is full, prints out the
     		variance of the full array, and starts to fill it again.
     
     
 Compile: gcc -Wall -pthread ex1b.c -lm -o ex1b
 Run: ./ex1b
	    

 Output: The program will print to standard out the variances calculated by the program when
 			the the array is full of primes
